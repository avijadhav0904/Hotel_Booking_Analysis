Hotel Booking Analysis
This project explores and analyzes a dataset containing hotel booking information to identify patterns in customer behavior, booking trends, and factors affecting cancellations. It is a data analysis project focused on gaining insights using Python and data visualization tools.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to understand booking patterns for two types of hotels (City Hotel and Resort Hotel) by analyzing factors such as lead time, booking cancellations, average daily rates, customer types, and more. Insights derived from this analysis can help hotel businesses improve decision-making and enhance customer experience.
